# LedDisplayCoord-html
Jquery and css to simulate 32x32 led display and provide coordinates for reuse.

This project was created to take some of the guesswork out of led-display coding.  By having an interactive screen, the user can see what they are designing and arrive at a polished product faster.

DIRECTIONS
```
Click a cell once to change to a color or black. White is the default starting color.
Click and drag over cells to change to a color or black.
Buttons to fill all cells black, fill all cells white.
Color buttons to change the working color.  
Window on upper right side of the screen displays array of value-pair strings.  To modify later.
```

Project began as black and white matrix and evolved to utilize color.  You may still see remnants of the black-and-white paradigm in the code.

TO DO
```
Create fill color button.
Create toggle for fill buttons that will determine if all cells are filled or only black cells. Potentially, create drop down and allow user to select the colored cells which will be changed. (i.e. select black cells and only black cells will be filled with the active color.
```

Once polished, I intend to used this webpage to update my led-display over the internet and impress my nephew.
