# LedDisplayCoord-html
Jquery and css to simulate 32x32 led display and provide coordinates for reuse.

This project was created to take some of the guesswork out of led-display coding.  By having an interactive screen, the user can see what they are designing and arrive at a polished product faster.

Click once on a cell changes its color to black, black cells are logged over on the right hand side of the page by letter/number.  Letters refer to the row, numbers refer to the column.  There are 32 rows on the table; once the 26th row is reached, successive rows are numbered with capital letters (i.e. A,B,...).

The clear all and fill buttons are currently functional, the circle and line buttons are not.

Once polished, I intend to used this webpage to update my led-display over the internet and impress my nephew.
